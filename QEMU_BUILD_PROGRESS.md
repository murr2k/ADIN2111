# QEMU Docker Build Progress Report

**Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Time:** ~20:45 UTC  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS  

## Build Fixes Applied

### âœ… Issue 1: QEMU Model Files Not Found
**Error:** `qemu/include/hw/net/adin2111.h: not found`  
**Fix:** Modified `.dockerignore` to not exclude `qemu/` directory  
**Result:** Files now correctly copied into Docker build context  

### âœ… Issue 2: APT Cache Mount Failures
**Error:** `apt-get update exit code: 100`  
**Fix:** Removed `--mount=type=cache` directives from Dockerfile  
**Result:** APT commands now execute successfully  

### âœ… Issue 3: QEMU Meson Build Error
**Error:** `Unknown variable "softmmu_ss"`  
**Fix:** Changed to `system_ss` for QEMU 9.1.0 compatibility  
**Result:** QEMU configure and build proceeding  

## Current Status

The Build QEMU Container job has been running for ~5 minutes, which is expected for a QEMU source build. The job is progressing through these stages:

1. âœ… Checkout code
2. âœ… Setup Docker Buildx
3. âœ… Login to GitHub Container Registry
4. âœ… Extract metadata
5. ðŸ”„ **Build and push Docker image** (Currently executing)
   - Building QEMU from source (v9.1.0)
   - Compiling ARM/AArch64 targets
   - Including ADIN2111 device model

## Expected Timeline

- QEMU source build: 5-10 minutes (depending on runner specs)
- Docker layer caching will speed up future builds
- Once complete, image will be pushed to `ghcr.io/murr2k/qemu-adin2111`

## Next Steps

Once the Docker build completes successfully:

1. The `test-driver-qemu` job will run using the built container
2. Tests will execute across multiple kernel versions (6.1, 6.6, 6.8)
3. Both ARM and ARM64 architectures will be tested
4. Performance analysis will be conducted

**Note:** First-time QEMU builds take longer. Subsequent builds will use Docker layer caching for faster execution.
