# ADIN2111 QEMU Integration Report

## Executive Summary
Successfully integrated the ADIN2111 dual-port 10BASE-T1L Ethernet switch/PHY device model into QEMU v9.0.0 build system, enabling the `-device adin2111` command for ARM virtual machines.

## Integration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Objectives Achieved
1. ✅ **QEMU Build System Integration** - Device successfully compiled and linked into QEMU
2. ✅ **Device Registration** - ADIN2111 appears in QEMU device list
3. ✅ **API Compatibility** - Updated to work with QEMU v9.0.0 SSI peripheral API
4. ✅ **ARM virt Machine Support** - Enabled for ARM virtual machine architecture

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`/home/murr2k/qemu/hw/net/adin2111.c`**
   - Updated SSI API from deprecated `SSISlave` to `SSIPeripheral`
   - Fixed device realization and unrealization functions
   - Corrected NIC initialization with proper memory reentrancy guards

2. **`/home/murr2k/qemu/hw/arm/Kconfig`**
   - Added ADIN2111 device selection to ARM_VIRT configuration
   - Enabled SSI bus support for virt machine

3. **`/home/murr2k/qemu/hw/net/Kconfig`**
   - Added ADIN2111 configuration entry

4. **`/home/murr2k/qemu/hw/net/meson.build`**
   - Added ADIN2111 compilation directive

5. **`/home/murr2k/qemu/include/hw/net/adin2111.h`**
   - Device header file already in place

### Key Challenges Resolved
1. **SSI API Changes** - QEMU v9.0.0 renamed SSI types from `SSISlave` to `SSIPeripheral`
2. **Build System Integration** - Properly configured Kconfig and Meson build files
3. **Device Registration** - Fixed type registration to make device available in QEMU

### Verification Results
```bash
$ qemu-system-arm -device help | grep adin2111
name "adin2111", bus SSI, desc "ADIN2111 Dual-Port 10BASE-T1L Ethernet Switch/PHY"
```

### Device Properties
- **Bus Type**: SSI (Synchronous Serial Interface)
- **Options**:
  - `cs=<uint8>` - Chip select (default: 0)
  - `mac=<str>` - Ethernet MAC address
  - `netdev=<str>` - Network backend ID

## Timing Specifications Implemented
As per ADIN2111 datasheet Rev. B:
- Reset time: 50ms
- PHY RX latency: 6.4µs
- PHY TX latency: 3.2µs
- Switch latency: 12.6µs
- Power-on time: 43ms

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. QEMU build with ADIN2111 support (completed)
2. ARM machine with SSI controller support
3. Appropriate kernel and device tree

### Example Command
```bash
# Note: Requires machine with SSI bus support
qemu-system-arm -M <ssi-capable-machine> \
    -device adin2111,id=eth0,mac=52:54:00:12:34:56
```

### For ARM virt Machine
The virt machine now has ADIN2111 enabled but requires SSI controller setup in the machine code or device tree for full functionality.

## Testing Performed
1. ✅ Build compilation without errors
2. ✅ Device registration in QEMU device list
3. ✅ Device property query successful
4. ✅ Object file generation verified

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Create device tree bindings for ADIN2111
2. Implement SSI controller instantiation in virt machine
3. Develop Linux kernel driver testing framework
4. Add qtest unit tests for device functionality
5. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

## Files Delivered
- Modified QEMU source files with ADIN2111 integration
- Test script: `test-adin2111-qemu.sh`
- Integration patches in `/home/murr2k/projects/ADIN2111/patches/`
- This integration report

## Conclusion
The ADIN2111 device model has been successfully integrated into QEMU's build system. The device is now available for use in ARM-based QEMU virtual machines that provide SSI bus support. All build issues have been resolved, and the device compiles cleanly with QEMU v9.0.0.
