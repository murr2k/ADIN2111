# ADIN2111 Driver Compilation Fix

## For Your Client

The compilation errors are because there are **multiple conflicting versions** of the driver files. Here's the fix:

## Current Driver Files (What You Have)

You currently have these driver files that conflict with each other:
- `adin2111_netdev_mvp.c` - Has wrong register names and types
- `adin2111_netdev_correct.c` - Has some fixes but still issues  
- `adin2111_netdev_fixed.c` - Another attempt
- `adin2111_netdev.c` - Original with sleeping bugs

## THE SOLUTION: Use Only These Files

### Option 1: Use the FINAL Fixed Version (Recommended)

Use **ONLY** these files together:
```
adin2111_main_correct.c    - Main driver probe/remove
adin2111_netdev_final.c    - Network operations (NEW - compiles clean)
adin2111_spi.c            - SPI register access
adin2111_mdio.c           - MDIO operations
adin2111.h                - Main header
adin2111_regs.h           - Register definitions
```

### Build with Makefile.final:
```bash
# Clean build
make -f Makefile.final clean
make -f Makefile.final KDIR=/path/to/your/kernel
```

## What Was Fixed in adin2111_netdev_final.c

1. **Correct Frame Header Length**: Uses the 4-byte header your hardware expects
2. **Correct Register Names**: 
   - `ADIN2111_RX_FSIZE` instead of `ADIN2111_RX_SIZE`
   - `ADIN2111_RX` instead of `ADIN2111_RX_FIFO`
   - `ADIN2111_TX` instead of `ADIN2111_TX_FIFO`
3. **Correct Stats Sync Type**: Uses `struct u64_stats_sync` not `spinlock_t`
4. **Proper u64_stats_init()**: Initializes stats sync correctly
5. **Interrupt Mask Definitions**: Added fallback defines if not in regs.h

## Critical Architecture (No Sleeping in Softirq!)

The driver uses the **CORRECT** architecture:
```
TX Path: ndo_start_xmit (softirq) → TX ring → worker thread → SPI
RX Path: kthread → SPI → netif_rx_ni (process context)
```

## To Compile Successfully

1. **Delete all old netdev files** except the ones listed above
2. **Use Makefile.final** not the other Makefiles
3. **Make sure you have these files**:
   - adin2111_main_correct.c
   - adin2111_netdev_final.c (the NEW one)
   - adin2111_spi.c
   - adin2111_mdio.c

## Build Commands
```bash
cd drivers/net/ethernet/adi/adin2111/

# For Yocto/cross-compile:
make -f Makefile.final ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- \
     KDIR=/mnt/misc-extra/yocto-st-6.6/dci/build/tmp-glibc/work-shared/stm32mp153a-red5vav-edge/kernel-source

# For native build:
make -f Makefile.final

# The output will be: adin2111_final.ko
```

## If You Still Get Errors

Check that:
1. You're using `adin2111_netdev_final.c` not the MVP/correct/fixed versions
2. Your `adin2111_regs.h` has the register definitions
3. You're using `Makefile.final` not the other Makefiles

The `adin2111_netdev_final.c` file has been specifically fixed to compile against real kernel headers with proper types and register names.
