	  This driver supports the Analog Devices ADIN2111 dual-port
	  10BASE-T1L Ethernet switch with integrated PHYs and SPI interface.

	  The driver can operate in two modes:
	  - Switch mode: Hardware switching between ports (default)
	  - Dual MAC mode: Separate network interfaces for each port

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called adin2111.

config ADIN2111_SWITCH_MODE
	bool "Enable hardware switch mode by default"
	depends on ADIN2111
	default y
	help
	  Enable hardware switch mode by default. In this mode, the
	  ADIN2111 performs autonomous switching between its two ports
	  without host involvement, reducing CPU load and latency.

	  This can be overridden via module parameter or device tree.

config ADIN2111_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debug messages"
	depends on ADIN2111
	help
	  Enable verbose debug messages for the ADIN2111 driver.
	  This is useful for development and troubleshooting.
