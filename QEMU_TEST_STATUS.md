# QEMU Test Workflow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Invalid `-device adin2111` Parameter
**Problem**: Test scripts were trying to use `-device adin2111,id=eth0` which failed because ADIN2111 is not a QEMU virtual device.

**Solution**: Removed all instances of `-device adin2111` from:
- `tests/qemu/run-qemu-test.sh`
- `tests/scripts/run-stm32mp153-docker-test.sh`
- `qemu/examples/test-adin2111.sh`

### 2. QEMU Model Compilation Error
**Problem**: Docker build was trying to compile a QEMU device model for ADIN2111 which had compilation errors.

**Solution**: Removed QEMU model compilation from `docker/qemu-adin2111.dockerfile` since ADIN2111 doesn't need a QEMU device model (it's an SPI slave handled by kernel driver).

## Current Status

- **Latest Run**: #17085093169
- **Commit**: 3936a70 (fix: Remove ADIN2111 QEMU model compilation)
- **Status**: Docker build in progress

## How ADIN2111 Should Work in QEMU

1. **No QEMU Device Model Needed**: ADIN2111 is an SPI peripheral, not a QEMU device
2. **Kernel Driver**: The Linux kernel driver handles all device operations
3. **SPI Bus**: Communication happens through the Linux SPI subsystem
4. **Device Tree**: Configuration via device tree or platform data

## Testing Approach

```bash
# Start QEMU without ADIN2111 device
qemu-system-arm \
    -M vexpress-a9 \
    -kernel zImage \
    -initrd initramfs.cpio.gz \
    -append "console=ttyAMA0" \
    -nographic

# Inside guest OS:
modprobe adin2111_driver  # Load driver
ip link show              # Check interfaces
```

## Commits Made

1. `b2a7763` - Remove invalid -device adin2111 from QEMU test scripts
2. `3936a70` - Remove ADIN2111 QEMU model compilation

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Docker build to complete
2. Verify QEMU tests pass without device parameter
3. Confirm driver loads properly in QEMU guest
4. Monitor for any remaining issues
