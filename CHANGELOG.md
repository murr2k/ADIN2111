## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading from 3.x to 4.0.0-hybrid

The 4.0.0-hybrid release is a complete rewrite. Follow these steps to upgrade:

1. **Backup Current Configuration**
   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/modprobe.d/adin2111.conf /etc/modprobe.d/adin2111.conf.bak
   ```

2. **Remove Old Driver**
   ```bash
   sudo rmmod adin2111
   sudo rm /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/net/ethernet/adi/adin2111.ko
   ```

3. **Build and Install New Driver**
   ```bash
   cd drivers/net/ethernet/adi/adin2111
   make clean
   make
   sudo make install
   sudo depmod -a
   ```

4. **Configure for Single Interface Mode (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   echo "options adin2111_hybrid single_interface_mode=1" | \
     sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/adin2111.conf
   ```

5. **Load New Driver**
   ```bash
   sudo modprobe adin2111_hybrid
   ```

6. **Verify Installation**
